1) Data Preparation:
Data Fetching: The notebook utilizes the yfinance library to download historical stock data for Tesla (TSLA) over a specified period (2011-2022).
Data Slicing: It extracts data specifically for the year 2021 to focus the analysis on a recent and relevant time period.

2) Calculation of Moving Averages:
44-day Moving Average: This short-term moving average helps smooth out daily price fluctuations and highlights trends.
100-day Moving Average: This longer-term moving average provides insight into the broader trend of the stock's performance.

3) Data Conversion:
The notebook converts the date index and relevant columns (adjusted close prices and moving averages) to numpy arrays to avoid multi-dimensional indexing errors, ensuring compatibility with matplotlib's plotting functions.

4) Visualization:
The plot visualizes the adjusted closing prices of Tesla's stock along with the calculated 44-day and 100-day moving averages.
Plot Customization: The x-axis is formatted to display month and year, and the grid is enabled for better readability. The x-axis labels are rotated for clarity, and a legend is included to differentiate between the lines.

5) Conclusion: 
The notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of Tesla's stock performance over the year 2021 by calculating and visualizing short-term and long-term moving averages. This helps in identifying trends and potential buy/sell signals based on the behavior of the moving averages in relation to the stock's adjusted closing prices. â€‹
